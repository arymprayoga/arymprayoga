# Hey there! üëã I'm Ary M Prayoga

**Software Engineer | Performance Optimizer | Problem Solver**

I'm a passionate software engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable web applications and solving complex performance challenges. I love diving deep into slow systems and coming out with solutions that make a real difference.

## üéØ Currently Open to New Opportunities!

I'm actively looking for my next challenge where I can contribute to building amazing products and optimizing systems that matter. If you're working on something interesting, let's chat!

## üöÄ What I Do Best

### Performance Engineering
I specialize in identifying bottlenecks and implementing solutions that deliver real impact:
- **Boosted slow API throughput by +75%** by rewriting N+1-heavy queries with CTEs & proper database indexes
- Deep expertise in query optimization, database design, and scalable architecture patterns
- Love turning "this is too slow" problems into "wow, that's fast!" solutions

### Full-Stack Development
I build complete web applications from database design to user interface:
- **Backend-focused** with strong full-stack capabilities
- Experience with high-traffic applications and complex business logic
- Clean, maintainable code that scales with your team and product

## üõ† My Technology Arsenal

**Backend Development (My Strong Suit)**
```
Ruby on Rails  ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà 95%  (My favorite!)
Golang         ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 80%  (Love the performance)
Laravel        ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 75%  (PHP powerhouse)
```

**Frontend & Database**
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vue.js
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL (with a focus on optimization)
- **DevOps**: Docker, GitHub Actions, Kamal deployment

## üí° Notable Projects

### üöó Automotive ERP System
*Laravel + Filament*
- Built a comprehensive ERP system for car dealerships
- Handled complex inventory management and sales workflows
- Focus on user experience and business process optimization

### üß† VARK Learning Assessment Platform
*Rails 8.0.2 API*
- Built a comprehensive web assessment platform for VARK learning style analysis
- Implemented JWT authentication and advanced result system with 15 learning style combinations
- Features order processing, payment integration, and digital certificate generation
- Developed RESTful API endpoints with ActiveAdmin for content management

## üé® My Development Philosophy

**Clean Code First**: I write code that future-me (and my teammates) will thank me for. Readable, maintainable, and well-tested.

**Performance Matters**: There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of turning a 10-second API call into a 200ms one. I dig deep to understand where the bottlenecks are.

**Pragmatic Problem Solving**: I love learning new technologies, but I believe in choosing the right tool for the job, not the newest one.

**Continuous Learning**: The tech world moves fast, and I move with it. Always exploring, always improving.

## üìö What I'm Working On

- Diving deeper into Go's concurrency patterns for high-performance backends
- Exploring advanced PostgreSQL features for even better query optimization
- Building side projects that challenge me to try new approaches

## ü§ù Let's Build Something Great Together

I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers, potential collaborators, or teams looking for someone who can:
- Jump into existing codebases and make immediate improvements
- Lead performance optimization initiatives
- Mentor junior developers and share knowledge
- Build new features from concept to deployment
